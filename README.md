# DiscordGreeterBot
This is a simple project that enables our greeter bot, WelcomeWhale. WelcomeWhale will send a DM if our informational links as well as a greeting in general chat.

## Use for your own

If you'd like to use this code on your own, you will need to create a new environment with [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

You will also need to create a ".env" file that contains the token for your server. [More information here](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/)
